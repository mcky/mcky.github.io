          <h2>About</h2>

          <p>
            I'm a full-stack developer based in London with a proven track
            record of breaking down problems, identifying efficient solutions,
            and delivering results. Over the past 10+ years, I've worked across
            industries - from early-stage startups to established agencies. My
            focus is on writing clean, functional code that solves real business
            needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            My core tech is Node.js, React, Typescript and their respective
            ecosystems, but I'm comfortable working in, and contributing to
            services built in a range of programming languages.<span

              I'm particularly interested in opportunities involving functional
              languages like Elixir or Clojure.</span

                Oak National Academy are a public body that provide teachers
                with free lesson planning and teaching resources. Between 2021
                and 2024 I was hired by Oak to work on a number of different projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>AI Labs</b>: In 2023 I was approached by Oak to help them
                take their LLM experiments from prototype scripts to production
                services. We launched 2 new AI tools to assist teachers,
                utilizing a novel approach of streaming LLM responses as
                structured JSON to the client, improving the UX of long-running
                prompts. Productionising these entailed instrumenting and adding
                authorization/access control, observability, reporting, custom
                back-office dashboards and service hardening. Ultimately the
                experiments proved successful and Oak are now integrating the AI
                features into their main apps.
              </p>

                Inngest, Langhchain, LLMOps, Retool, Redis, tRPC
              </p>

              <p>
                Prior to AI labs I worked on many different projects at Oak,
                with responsibilities spanning the entirety of their tech stack,
                from feature work and performance tuning to video processing
                pipelines and large scale migrations. I also championed
                Typescript adoption at Oak, convincing key stakeholders on the
                engineering team, mentoring team members on advanced Typescript
                techniques, and leading later efforts on E2E/runtime type-safety
              </p>

              <!-- <p>
                Prior to AI Labs I worked with Oak on a number of different
                projects, spanning the entirety of their tech stack. One
                highlight was redeveloping and re-launching their asset
                downloads experience. By enabling bulk downloads of entire
                lessons or collections of lessons, and streamlining the (fully
                accessible) UI, we were able to save teachers a lot of time. On
                the back-end, the service was extended to zip bundles of assets
                together, intelligently caching them to reduce download times.

              A multi-disciplinary degree focusing on creative applications of
              technology, in my final year I focused on applications of wearable
              technology. For my thesis I developed a prototype 3D-printed
              wearable, using BLE to communicate with a companion iOS app
              (Obj-C) and the accompanying web services backing it.

            I'm a keen cyclist, and spent spring/summer of 2024 cycle touring
            around europe, from London to Prague over ~3000km. I hope one day to
            resume the trip and continue through Asia.
