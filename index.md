# Ross Mackay

## About

I'm a London based full-stack developer with a breadth of experience across product startups and agencies. I'm happiest writing clean, functional code, solving real business needs and streamlining operations.

These days I'm usually writing React or node commercially, but I've got experience integrating with and prototyping in a wide range of stacks/languages.
