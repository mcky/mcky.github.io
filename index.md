# Ross Mackay

## About

I'm a London based web developer, specialising in front-end, with full-stack, product and hardware experience, usually working between the fast-paced worlds of agencies and product startups. I'm happiest writing clean, functional code powering seamless user experiences.

These days I'm usually writing React (+ redux etc) or node commercially, but I've got experience integrating with and prototyping in wide range of stacks/languages.
