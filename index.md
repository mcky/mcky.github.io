# Ross Mackay

## About

I'm a London based developer, specialising in front-end, with full-stack, product and hardware experience. I've got a keen interest in UX, rapid prototyping and creative uses of technology.

I work mostly with startups and agencies and produce my best work when collaborating closely with designers and back-end developers, ideally with some input in product design/direction.

My preferred technologies are React, Node and sass, but I've got experience integrating with Django/Rails apps and prototyping in Swift, Arduino and Python. Recently I've been aiming to improve my functional programming skills and trying to practice component/style-guide driven design and development.
