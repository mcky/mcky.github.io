# Ross Mackay

## About

I'm a London based full-stack developer with a breadth of experience across product startups and agencies. I enjoy writing clean, functional code powering seamless user experiences.

These days I'm usually writing React or node commercially, but I've got experience integrating with and prototyping in wide range of stacks/languages.
